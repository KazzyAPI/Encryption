# Encryption
The goal of this project is to be able to serve as a bundler for node.js. 

## What it does.
The small script will fetch from an api a encryption key, then decrypt the text file, followed by running it.

## Why this?
This is a journey to document my progress for me and anyone that wants to contribute, everything will be open source.
